## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

This challenge was build to learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as now [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is one of the most popular CSS framework. In the past, I've used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as my CSS and JS framework. But after I work on this challenge I found out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is more easy to use and easy to customize for building website.

In this challenge I learn a lot from [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to define the classes for every CSS property. This challenge is pretty simple I think, to get started and adjust with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) environment. I'm aware that there still a lot of things to learn from this CSS framework, and I'm looking forward to study more and more!

**Note: I'm so sorry for my bad English XD. I'm still learning to it âœŒ**
